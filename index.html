        <div id="intro">
            <p>In an increasingly interconnected world, it is more important than ever to be able to understand the
                factors that contribute to global happiness.
                Using data gathered by the Gallup World Poll, we can estimate the average quality life, and happiness,
                across the worldâ€™s nations based on several
                important factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption,
                and generosity.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, given the deep connections that exist between countries, it is important to consider the
                impact of trade, and the contributions that
                global connectedness has on happiness. As you explore this visualization, consider: Are countries with
                higher happiness scores more likely to
                engage in prosperous trade relationships? Do certain trade patterns contribute to increased happiness
                levels? What relationship is there
                between geography, trade patterns, and national happiness?
            </p>
            <p>In addition, feel free to hover over specific countries of interest to get a closer look at how each
                factor influenced its overall happiness score. You can also use the dropdown below the map to display
                the trade information for any country in the OECD database!
